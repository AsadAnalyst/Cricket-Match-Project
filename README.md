# Cricket-Match-Project

#design the program structure in C++ using OOP inheritance, Composition and aggregation constructs:

1. Create a game of cricket match. There will be two teams competing against each other: You & ‘The Computer’.
2. The game will be a T-1 match i.e., one one over each or 6 balls each.
3. Both teams will have 3 players each.
4. A toss will take place. Either you or the computer will play first.
5. Against each ball a random number will be generated between 0 to 7.
  • Numbers 0 – 6 represent the runs made
  • If the number 7 is generated it means that the player is out.

6. The game for the first team will end if either all six balls have been played OR all team members are out.
7. At the end of the first innings, score of the first team will be displayed along with how many players were still left to play.
8. The second team will play afterwards. Against each ball a new random number will be generated between 0 to 7. The total of these would represent the score that the second team made. Score of the team playing will be displayed.
9. Finally, at the end of the game, the results would be displayed i.e. which team won & which team lost. It will be a tie if both the teams scored the same number of runs & had equal number of players left to play.
10.Run rate of individual players for each team will be displayed as well & the Best Man of the match is calculated (independent of the winning/losing team).
